#   üì°‚ú® ESP32 Web-Powered Radar: See the Unseen! ‚ú®üì°

**Ever wanted to build your own radar? Now you can!**

This project isn't just code; it's an *experience*. We're diving into the fascinating world of radar technology, bringing it to life with the ESP32 and a stunning web interface. Get ready to watch objects appear on your screen as if by magic!

**Imagine:**

* Seeing the exact distance of an object across the room.
* Watching the radar sweep, painting a picture of its surroundings.
* Building a project that's both educational *and* seriously cool.

This project delivers all of that, combining the power of embedded systems with the elegance of web visualization.

**Here's a glimpse of the radar interface:**

**üî• Why This Project Will Blow Your Mind üî•**

* **Ultrasonic Vision:** We harness the precision of ultrasonic sensors (like the HC-SR04) to "see" the world. These sensors emit sound waves and listen for echoes, calculating distances with impressive accuracy. It's like giving your ESP32 superpowers!
* **Servo-Guided Sweep:** A nimble servo motor precisely controls the direction of the sensor, enabling it to scan a 180-degree field. This rotational dance creates the radar's sweeping motion, bringing its environment into focus.
* **Dynamic Web Interface:** Forget boring text output! The ESP32 hosts a *live*, interactive web page that visualizes the radar's findings. Powered by the magic of Processing.js, you'll get:
    * **Pinpoint Accuracy:** Distance is displayed in centimeters, updated in real time.
    * **Angle Precision:** The servo's exact angle is shown, indicating the direction of the scan.
    * **Captivating Visuals:** A sleek radar display animates the sweep and plots detected objects, making it incredibly intuitive.
* **Wireless Freedom:** The ESP32's built-in WiFi lets you access the radar data from any device on your network. No wires, no hassle!
* **Arduino Simplicity:** The code is written in the accessible Arduino IDE. This means you can easily understand, modify, and customize the project to your heart's content.

**üéÅ What Treasures Await You in This Repository? üéÅ**

* **ESP32 Code (`*.ino`):** The complete Arduino code that orchestrates the sensors, servo, and web server. It's your key to unlocking the radar's secrets.
* **Web Visualization (`html.h`):** The HTML and Processing.js code that creates the dynamic and engaging radar display.
